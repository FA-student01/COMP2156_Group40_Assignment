DevOps in the software development cycle
DevOps integrates development and operations to improve collaboration and streamline software delivery.
It follows the DevOps lifecycle, which includes planning, development, building, testing, release, deployment, operations, and monitoring.
Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that code changes are automatically tested and merged frequently.
Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the release process, enabling fast and reliable software updates.
DevOps uses version control systems (VCS) like Git to track changes and manage code efficiently.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows automated provisioning and management of infrastructure using tools like Terraform.
Monitoring and logging help identify and resolve issues quickly, improving system reliability.
Automation of repetitive tasks enhances efficiency and reduces human errors in software development.
The DevOps approach leads to faster delivery, higher-quality software, and improved collaboration between teams.

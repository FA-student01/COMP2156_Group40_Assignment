My College Introduction

George Brown College is a public college, located in Downtown Toronto, Ontario. There are three campus across the Toronto area which are Casa loma, St. James Campus and Waterfront Campus beside lake Ontario. Interesting side of my college is that, my college is known as hotpot of Canadian education institute.

The college was established during the formation of Ontario's community college system in 1967. Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology were established on May 21, 1965. The college is named after George Brown, who was an important 19th-century politician and newspaper publisher (he founded the Toronto Globe, forerunner to The Globe and Mail) and was one of the Fathers of Confederation.

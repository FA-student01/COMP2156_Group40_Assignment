The COMP 3104 DevOps course at George Brown College focuses on bridging the gap between software development and IT operations.

It bridges the gap between developers (who write the code) and IT operations (who deploy and maintain the code) to make software delivery faster, more reliable, and efficient.

Students learn version control using Git and GitHub for efficient teamwork.

The course covers Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines.

Students gain hands-on experience with automation tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform and Ansible is introduced.

Cloud computing with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud is an important part of the curriculum.

The course prepares students for DevOps careers in software development and IT.
